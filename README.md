# SM-Project
Overview
Welcome to the Social Media Project repository! This project aims to create a unique and innovative social media platform, providing users with a safe space to share their thoughts, images, videos, and links in a blog-style format. Unlike traditional social media, our platform emphasizes real-time interactions and the ability to encapsulate life digitally.
